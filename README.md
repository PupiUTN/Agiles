## 1. Our Manifesto

The hardest part of making software is precisely deciding what to do. No other part in which this work is divided is as difficult as establishing detailed technical requirements, including all interfaces with people, machines and other software systems. No other part of the job destroys the end result so much if it is done badly. No other part is so difficult to rectify a posteriori.

Therefore, the most important function performed by the software designer for the client is the iterative extraction and refinement of the product requirements. The truth is that the client does not know what he wants.
